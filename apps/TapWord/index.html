      <h1>Welcome to TapWord</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        A camera-based English word lookup tool designed for readers of physical books.
        Point your camera at any English text, tap any word, and instantly see its dictionary definition.
        Perfect for language learners reading English books.
      </p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

      <h3>1. Does TapWord require an internet connection?</h3>
      <p>No. TapWord works completely offline. Text recognition and dictionary lookups are performed locally on your device using Apple's built-in Vision and Dictionary frameworks.</p>

      <h3>2. How do I use TapWord?</h3>
      <p>
        Simply open the app and point your camera at an English book page.
        The app will automatically recognize all words and highlight them.
        Tap any word to see its definition in a popup dictionary.
      </p>

      <h3>3. What types of text can TapWord recognize?</h3>
      <p>
        TapWord is optimized for printed English text in books, magazines, and documents.
        It works best with clear, well-lit printed text. Handwritten text is not supported.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Why can't I see the definition for some words?</h3>
      <p>
        TapWord uses your device's built-in dictionary. Proper nouns, abbreviations, and very specialized terms may not have definitions.
        Make sure you have dictionaries installed: go to Settings > General > Dictionary and download the dictionaries you need.
      </p>

      <h3>5. How do I get Chinese/Japanese/other language definitions?</h3>
      <p>
        Go to your iPhone's Settings > General > Dictionary, then download the bilingual dictionary you need
        (e.g., "English-Chinese" or "English-Japanese"). TapWord will then show definitions in your preferred language.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Does TapWord save my lookup history?</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, TapWord does not save lookup history. Each session starts fresh.
        Future versions may include a vocabulary notebook feature for saving words.
      </p>

      <h3>7. What are the best conditions for using TapWord?</h3>
      <p>
        For best results: ensure good lighting, hold the camera about 20-30cm from the page,
        keep the book flat or slightly tilted, and make sure the text is in focus.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Why is the camera not working?</h3>
      <p>
        Make sure you have granted camera permission. Go to Settings > TapWord and enable Camera access.
        Also ensure no other app is using the camera. Note: TapWord requires a physical iPhone device and does not work in the Simulator.
      </p>

      <h3>9. What is left-hand and right-hand mode?</h3>
      <p>
        TapWord offers left-hand and right-hand mode settings to optimize the interface layout
        for your preferred hand. This makes it easier to hold your phone and tap words
        comfortably while reading. You can change this in Settings > Hand Mode.
      </p>

      <h3>10. What languages are supported?</h3>
      <p>
        TapWord currently recognizes English printed text. The app interface supports 14 languages:
        English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German,
        Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Thai, and Vietnamese.
